# MACHINE LEARNING CASE STUDY WORK..RAT

1. EXPLANATORY DATA ANALYSIS
Understanding the structure of the dataset,Checking for missing values,Descriptive statistics
2. Use Linear regression to train your data on and get evaluation aspects in terms of MAE, RMSE, and MSE.To perform linear regression on the insurance dataset, we first need to preprocess the data by converting the categorical variables (sex, smoker, and region) into numerical variables using one-hot encoding. We also need to split the data into training and testing set.
3. Using the bank churn data, carry out EDA and Logistic regression to predict whether a customer will churn. To perform EDA and logistic regression on the bank churn data, we first need to load the data and import the necessary libraries.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We can begin the EDA process by looking at the shape and summary statistics of the dataset.
Next, we can visualize the distribution of the target variable and explore the relationship between the target variable and other features.
 4. Add the use of ensemble models of Random forests, Boosting and stacking models to create ensemble models to analyze the above datasets.   
To use ensemble models of Random forests, Boosting, and stacking models on the above datasets, we need to split the data into training and testing sets and perform some preprocessing steps. We will start by loading the data and importing the necessary libraries.
